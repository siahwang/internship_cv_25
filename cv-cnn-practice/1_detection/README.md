# 1. Object Detection Practice with YOLOv5

This folder contains practical experiments using the YOLOv5 object detection model on the COCO dataset.

## Objectives
- Understand the object detection pipeline using CNNs
- Run and evaluate YOLOv5 on the COCO val2017 set
- Observe performance metrics such as mAP and FPS under different conditions

## Dataset
- COCO val2017

## Experiments Covered
- Comparison of YOLOv5 variants (n, s, m, l) in terms of accuracy vs. speed
- Effect of confidence threshold on precision-recall trade-off
- (Optional) IoU threshold tuning for NMS, if added later

## Output
- All experiments and visualizations are included in `yolov5-sia.ipynb`
